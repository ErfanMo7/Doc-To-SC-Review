A blockchain-based integrated document management framework for construction applications,"Das, M; Tao, XY; Liu, YH; Cheng, JCP","Document management systems in AEC projects manage important project documents such as schedules, RFIs, and change orders. Hence, security concerns in document management systems especially involving data integrity of documents and records may have a severe effect on a project in terms of money and the reputations of project participants. Therefore, in this research blockchain technology is leveraged to facilitate data integrity in document management for construction applications through - (1) irreversible and irrevocable approval workflow logic via smart contract technology, (2) irreversible recording of document changes via blockchain ledger technology, and (3) document version history integrity via a blockchain-based data structure. A prototype of the proposed smart contract framework was developed using Hyperledger fabric and evaluated. The scalability of the proposed framework to support document version integrity was also evaluated and discussed. A formulation based on existing literature is developed to evaluate the cost viability of the proposed framework.",2022,,AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION,133,,,WOS:000716642800007,10.1016/j.autcon.2021.104001,,#1,Das 2022,Exclusion reason: Framework Not Provided; ,""
Reconfigurable Smart Contracts for Renewable Energy Exchange with Re-Use of Verification Rules,"Gorski, T","Smart contracts constitute the foundation for blockchain distributed applications. These constructs enable transactions in trustless environments using consensus algorithms and software-controlled verification rules. In the current state of the art, there is a shortage of works on the adaptability of smart contracts, and the re-use of their source code is limited mainly to cloning. The paper discusses the pattern of smart contract design and implementation with the overt declaration of verification rules. The author introduces two advantages of the pattern: Firstly, run-time reconfigurability of the list of smart contract verification rules to adjust for various transaction types. Secondly, the re-use of verification rules between different configurations of the smart contract, and among diverse smart contracts. The paper uses blockchain platform-independent stereotypes from a dedicated Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile for designing smart contracts and verification rules. The implementation of the pattern is developed in object-oriented Java language. The pattern exploits polymorphism and controls inheritance by using sealed classes with permission for specialization only for selected final ones. Thus, the pattern ensures two recently highly desired properties in smart contract design and development: re-use and security. Moreover, the declared verification rules list facilitates test automation and reduces test preparation effort due to the re-use of test classes among smart contract configurations. The pattern usage is illustrated in the example of renewable energy exchange within the prosumers community and amid various communities.",2022,,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,12,11,,WOS:000808644800001,10.3390/app12115339,,#6,Gorski 2022,Exclusion reason: Research that is not related to contract or document conversion to smart contracts; ,""
Solidity Code Generation From UML State Machines in Model-Driven Smart Contract Development,"Jurgelaitis, M; Ceponiene, L; Butkiene, R","For the development of blockchain smart contracts, a structured approach based on the principles of the Model Driven Architecture can be beneficial and facilitate the implementation of smart contracts. This paper presents such an approach, which, in combination with Unified Modeling Language (UML) Class and State machine diagrams, allows the smart contract structure and behavior logic to be modeled in several abstraction layers. This paper delves into details on how the model-to-model transformations from the specified Blockchain Platform Independent Model (PIM) with specified state-like behavior can be used to produce a Solidity Platform Specific Model (PSM). Subsequently, we elaborate on how the Solidity PSM is used for Solidity smart contract code generation by employing model-to-text transformations. The paper also demonstrates the process of our proposed transformations and code generation using smart contract code examples from Solidity documentation. Based on the examples, a Blockchain PIM is specified and transformed to Solidity PSM, which is then used for Solidity smart contract code generation. The generated smart contract code is then compiled, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain JavaScript virtual machine, and compared to the original smart contract code in terms of Solidity code metrics, similarity scores, and execution costs. The evaluation results indicate that our approach could be successfully used to model and later generate smart contract code.",2022,,IEEE ACCESS,10,,33465-33481,WOS:000777130700001,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3162227,,#17,Jurgelaitis 2022,Exclusion reason: Articles that focus solely on technical aspects of conversion; ,""
The Automatic Generation of Smart Contract Based on Configuration in the Field of Government Services,"Zhang, YY; Zhang, JR; Zhang, H","With the development of blockchain technology, the automatic generation of smart contract has become a hot research topic. The existing smart contract automatic generation technology still has improvement spaces in complex process, third-party specialized tools required, specific the compatibility of code and running environment.

It is designed and implemented with the application scenarios of government service. The process of configuration, public state database definition, code generation and formal verification are included. In the Hyperledger Fabric environment, the applicability of the generated smart contract code is verified. Furthermore, its quality and security are formally verified with the help of third-party testing tools.

Intelligible Description Language Contract (IDLC) - A Novel Smart Contract Model,"Qin, P; Tan, WM; Guo, JZ; Shen, BQ","The development of Industry 4.0, smart contract is one of critical application in the blockchain platform, which is the remove of intermediary services to facilitate transactions directly between stakeholders, in which the trust between stakeholders is guaranteed by a blockchain system. However, existing solution of automated execution of smart contract is simply given by the prescribed program code. This solution results in two negative effects: the contract is not human-readable and difficult to modify; contracting parties cannot collaboratively draft the contract and cannot assure the shared consent of the contract. Therefore, we will introduce a brand-new solution of smart contract, called Intelligible Description Language Contract (IDLC). It will allow contracting parties to draft a contract collaboratively just as working on text editor with a supportive tool of concept disambiguation through Supervised Sentence Contract (SSC). SSC consists of Machine Natural language (MNL) via Semantic input method (SIM). SIM provides a method of supervised contract obligation creation. MNL provides the capability of universal computer-understandability. Meanwhile, in the complex contract transactions and management, especially in supply chain management, a chained evidence sequence is designed to avoid collusion. IDLC is a first paradigm that bridges the traditional contract based on natural languages and the smart contract based on blockchain platform.",,,INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS,,,,WOS:000650301100001,10.1007/s10796-021-10138-4,,#32,,Exclusion reason: Articles that focus solely on technical aspects of conversion; ,""
Financial Contract Administration in Construction via Cryptocurrency Blockchain and Smart Contract: A Proof of Concept,"Ibrahim, R; Harby, AA; Nashwan, MS; Elhakeem, A","The blockchain that uses cryptocurrency is a paradigm shift in the way of data storage, retrieval, and verification due to the concept of decentralization. This paradigm is essential to ensure the security of crucial data in any project. Adding a smart contract to the blockchain would facilitate the automation of various processes. Thus, the cryptocurrency blockchain that uses the smart contract can be considered a suitable platform for an ecosystem of many industries. The construction industry needs a highly secure automated management system due to its complex contractual relationships and transactions between parties. Therefore, integrating the blockchain with the smart contract creates the most appropriate ecosystem to be developed. This study introduces an ecosystemic prototype using a programmable smart contract within a novel cryptocurrency blockchain for construction. The purpose of the prototype is to guarantee a decentralized system as an independent economic environment for the construction industry. The system guarantees the security of financial transactions and focuses on the payment clauses in the construction contract as well. The results depended on three well-known hypothetical case scenarios from the construction site and were displayed in the form of extracted access data tables. The prototype proved the efficiency of the decentralized system for the construction industry by minimizing human-factor interference in the transaction process and thus reducing time waste and cost.",2022,,BUILDINGS,12,8,,WOS:000845095200001,10.3390/buildings12081072,,#73,Ibrahim 2022,Exclusion reason: Articles that focus solely on technical aspects of conversion; ,""
iContractML 2.0: A domain-specific language for modeling and deploying smart contracts onto multiple blockchain platforms,"Hamdaqa, M; Met, LAP; Qasse, I","Context: Smart contracts play a vital role in many fields. Despite being called smart, the development of smart contracts is a tedious task beyond defining a set of contractual rules. In addition to business knowledge, coding a smart contract requires strong technical knowledge in a multiplex of new and rapidly changing domain-specific languages and blockchain platforms. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to assist developers in building smart contracts independently from the language or the target blockchain platform. In which, we present our second-generation smart contract language iContractML 2.0. Methods: We follow a feature-oriented approach to analyze three different blockchain platforms and propose an enhanced reference model and a modeling framework for smart contracts (iContractML 2.0). Then, we evaluate the coverage and extensibility of iContractML 2.0, first through mapping the concepts of the reference models to the constructs within each of the platforms used in devising the reference model, and second through mapping its concepts to a new smart contract language not previously considered. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of iContractML 2.0 using five case studies from different business domains. Results: iContractML 2.0 extends our first generation language to support DAML, which is another standardized language for smart contracts. This makes iContractML 2.0 supports the platforms that DAML support by extension. Moreover, iContractML 2.0 supports generating the structural and deployment artifacts in addition to the smart contract behavior by implementing templates for some of the common functions. The results of evaluating the generality of the iContractML 2.0 reference model show that it is 91.7% lucid and 72.2% laconic. Moreover, the reference model is able to capture all the elements of the new language with 83.3% of the components which have a direct one-to-one mapping. Conclusion: iContractML 2.0 is an extensible framework that empowers developers to model and generate functional smart contract code that can be deployed onto multiple blockchain platforms.",2022,,INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY,144,,,WOS:000745098800005,10.1016/j.infsof.2021.106762,,#95,Hamdaqa 2022,Exclusion reason: Articles that focus solely on technical aspects of conversion; ,""
A conceptual framework for blockchain smart contract adoption to manage real estate deals in smart cities,"Ullah, F; Al-Turjman, F","Blockchains-based smart contracts are disrupting the smart real estate sector of the smart cities. The current study explores the literature focused on blockchain smart contracts in smart real estate and proposes a conceptual framework for its adoption in smart cities. Based on a systematic review method, the literature published between 2000 and 2020 is explored and analyzed. From the literature, ten key aspects of the blockchain smart contracts are highlighted that are grouped into six layers for adopting the smart contracts in smart real estate. The decentralized application and its interactions with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) are presented to show the development of a smart contract that can be used for blockchain smart contracts in real estate. Further, a detailed design and interaction mechanism are highlighted for the real estate owners and users as parties to a smart contract. A list of functions for initiating, creating, modifying, or terminating a smart contract is presented along with a stepwise procedure for establishing and terminating smart contracts. The current study can help the users enjoy a more immersive, user-friendly, and visualized contracting process, whereas the owners, property technologies (Proptech) companies, and real estate agents can enjoy more business and sales. This can help disrupt traditional real estate and transform it into smart real estate in line with industry 4.0 requirements.",2023,,NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS,35,7,5033-5054,WOS:000620432400001,10.1007/s00521-021-05800-6,,#128,Ullah 2023,Exclusion reason: Research that is not related to contract or document conversion to smart contracts; ,""
Automated Payment and Contract Management in the Construction Industry by Integrating Building Information Modeling and Blockchain-Based Smart Contracts,"Sigalov, K; Ye, XL; Konig, M; Hagedorn, P; Blum, F; Severin, B; Hettmer, M; Huckinghaus, P; Wolkerling, J; Gross, D","Construction projects usually involve signing various contracts with specific billing procedures. In practice, dealing with complex contract structures causes significant problems, especially with regard to timely payment and guaranteed cash flow. Furthermore, a lack of transparency leads to a loss of trust. As a result, late or non-payment is a common problem in the construction industry. This paper presents the concept of implementing smart contracts for automated, transparent, and traceable payment processing for construction projects. Automated billing is achieved by combining Building Information Modeling (BIM) approaches with blockchain-based smart contracts. Thereby, parts of traditional construction contracts are transferred to a smart contract. The smart contract is set up using digital BIM-based tender documents and contains all of the relevant data for financial transactions. Once the contracted construction work has been accepted by the client, payments can be made automatically via authorized financial institutions. This paper describes the framework, referred to as BIMcontracts, the container-based data exchange, and the digital contract management workflow. It discusses the industry-specific requirements for blockchain and data storage and explains which technical and software architectural decisions were made.

Towards Auto Contract Generation and Ensemble-based Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection,"Puducherry, KL; Puducherry, KS","Smart contracts (SC) are computer programs that are major components of Blockchain. The ""intelligent contract "" is made up of the rules accepted by the parties concerned. When the transactions started by the parties obey these established rules, then only their transactions will be completed without the involvement of a third party. Because of the simplicity and succinct nature of the solidity language, most smart contracts are written in this language. Smart contracts have two limitations, which are vulnerabilities in SC and that smart contracts can't be understood by all stakeholders, especially non-technical people who are involved in the business, since they are written in a programming language. Hence, the proposed paper used the XGBoost model and BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) tool to solve the first and second limitations of the SC respectively. Attackers are drawn to attention because of the popularity and fragility of the Solidity language. Once smart contracts have been launched, they can't be changed. If that smart contract is vulnerable, attackers may then cash it. BPMN is used to represent business rules or contracts in graphical notation, so everyone involved in the business can understand the business rules. This BPMN diagram can be converted into a smart contract template through the BPMN-SOL tool. A few publications and existing tools exist on smart contract vulnerability detection, but they require more time to forecast and interpretation of vulnerability causes is also difficult. Thus, the proposed model experimented with several deep learning approaches and improved F1 score results by an average of 2% using the XGBoost model based on the ensemble technique to detect vulnerabilities of SCs, which are: Denial of Service (DOS), Unchecked external call, Re-entrancy, and Origin of Transaction. This paper also combined two important features to construct a data set, which are code snippets and n-grams.",2022,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING SYSTEMS,13,9,747-757,WOS:000896768100003,,,#167,Puducherry 2022,Exclusion reason: Methods/inputs/outputs not provided; ,""
Automating Smart Contract Generation on Blockchains Using Multi-modal Modeling,"Liu, CG; Bodorik, P; Jutla, D","The power and correctness of smart contracts have been the focus of much research. We propose a new approach for developing smart contracts that uses multi-modal modeling to represent the application logic for the trade domain. We use discrete events modeling for concurrency combined with FSM modeling to use concurrent FSMs to not only simplify the design process for the modeler, but also to scale the application running on a blockchain and facilitate identifying parts of a smart program that are suitable for off-chain processing on a sidechain that also provides privacy. In addition, we achieve separation of concerns between (a) application logic and (b) its transformation into a smart contract and deployment on a blockchain with processing of selected patterns on private sidechains. We transform the model into a smart contract automatically, such that patterns, selected by the modeler, are deployed on a sidechain. The interface for the mainchain to sidechain interaction is also prepared and deployed automatically.",2022,,JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,13,3,213-223,WOS:000884923300002,10.12720/jait.13.3.213-223,,#177,Liu 2022,Exclusion reason: Framework Not Provided; ,""
Smart contracts vs incomplete contracts: A transaction cost economics viewpoint,"Vatiero, M","Smart contracts (i.e., agreements enforced by a blockchain) are supposed to work at lower transaction costs than traditional (and incomplete) contracts that instead exploit a costly legal enforcement. This paper challenges that claim. I argue that because of the need for adaptation to mutable and unpredictable occurrences (a chief challenge of transaction cost economics a la Oliver Williamson), smart contracts may incur higher transaction costs than traditional contracts. This paper focuses on two problems related to the adaptation: first, smart contracts are constructed to limit and potentially avoid any ex-post legal intervention, including efficiency-enhancing adaptation by courts. Second, the consensus mechanism on which every smart contract depends may lead to additional transaction costs due to a majority-driven adaptation of the blockchain that follows Mancur Olson's Logic of groups. The paper further proposes several institutional expedients that may reduce these transaction costs of smart contracts. (C) 2022 Massimiliano Vatiero. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Blockchain-Based Distributed Patient-Centric Image Management System,"Jabarulla, MY; Lee, HN","In recent years, many researchers have focused on developing a feasible solution for storing and exchanging medical images in the field of health care. Current practices are deployed on cloud-based centralized data centers, which increase maintenance costs, require massive storage space, and raise privacy concerns about sharing information over a network. Therefore, it is important to design a framework to enable sharing and storing of big medical data efficiently within a trustless environment. In the present paper, we propose a novel proof-of-concept design for a distributed patient-centric image management (PCIM) system that is aimed to ensure safety and control of patient private data without using a centralized infrastructure. In this system, we employed an emerging Ethereum blockchain and a distributed file system technology called Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). Then, we implemented an Ethereum smart contract called the patient-centric access control protocol to enable a distributed and trustworthy access control policy. IPFS provides the means for decentralized storage of medical images with global accessibility. We describe how the PCIM system architecture facilitates the distributed and secured patient-centric data access across multiple entities such as hospitals, patients, and image requestors. Finally, we deployed a smart contract prototype on an Ethereum testnet blockchain and evaluated the proposed framework within the Windows environment.

A Proof-of-Stake public blockchain based pricing scheme for peer-to-peer energy trading,"Yang, JW; Paudel, A; Gooi, HB; Nguyen, HD","Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading allows prosumers to trade energy directly without intermediaries. To provide a payment system and record transaction information, public blockchain is designed to match the decentralized feature of the P2P market. The incentive for nodes outside the microgrid is removed but it is maintained for the prosumers within the microgrid. Therefore the number of miner competitors is limited to decrease the mining difficulty and its power consumption. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocol defines the function of blockchain with its mining mechanism. Miners sacrifice part of their stake to compensate for the power losses and reduce the price gap from the traditional prosumer-to-grid trading (Feed-in-tariff). Moreover, the proposed model also contributes to increase the social welfare by improving producers' income and consumers' cost-saving through the designed pricing scheme, which eliminates the price gap between buying and selling. Successful mining is encouraged by rewards accordingly. A case study is introduced where a microgrid model with 27 prosumers is tested with the PoS public blockchain-based pricing scheme.

ST-BFL: A Structured Transparency Empowered Cross-Silo Federated Learning on the Blockchain Framework,"Majeed, U; Khan, LU; Yousafzai, A; Han, Z; Park, BJ; Hong, CS","Federated Learning (FL) relies on on-device training to avoid the migration of devices' data to a centralized server to address privacy leakage. Moreover, FL is feasible for scenarios (e.g., autonomous cars) where an enormous amount of data is generated every day. Transferring only local model updates in the case of FL is highly communication-efficient compared to transferring all data in the case of centralized machine learning (ML). Although FL offers many advantages, it also has some challenges. A malicious aggregation server can infer device information via local model updates. Another downside of FL is the centralized aggregation server that can malfunction due to an attack or physical damage. To address these issues, we propose a novel Structured Transparency empowered cross-silo Federated Learning on the Blockchain (ST-BFL) framework. In ST-BFL, homomorphic encryption, FL-aggregators, FL-verifiers, and smart contract are employed, which satisfy various structured transparency components, such as input privacy, output privacy, output verification, and flow governance. We present the framework architecture, algorithms, and sequence diagram of our ST-BFL framework to show how different entities interact in ST-BFL for the FL process. We also present a simplified class diagram of ST-BFL's smart contract for an FL task. Finally, we perform a simulation to analyze our framework from the perspective of aggregation time, accuracy, and storage size.

A Novel Blockchain-Based Integrity and Reliable Veterinary Clinic Information Management System Using Predictive Analytics for Provisioning of Quality Health Services,"Iqbal, N; Jamil, F; Ahmad, S; Kim, D","The recent advances in information management systems coupled with machine learning algorithms paved the way for a significant revolution in animal healthcare industries. However, the data in such systems suffer from various challenges such as security, reliability, and convenience, to name a few. Traditional systems are not useful to meet these critical issues because these systems have not a consistent structure for data security and reliability policies. Therefore, a new solution is required to enhance data accessibility and should regulate government security policies to ensure the accountability of the usage of the medical records system. Moreover, it is also required to analyze historical data of veterinary clinic using data mining and machine learning techniques to predict the future appointments scheduling requests, which is essential for veterinary management to drive better future decisions, for instance, future demands of medical supplies and to plan veterinary medical staff, etc. This paper aims to fill the gap by proposing a novel blockchain-based reliable and intelligent veterinary information management system (RIVIMS) using smart contract and machine learning techniques. The proposed RIVIMS consists of two main modules; blockchain-based secured veterinary information management, data and predictive analytics modules. First, a blockchain-based secure and reliable veterinary clinic information management system is developed using Hyperledger Fabric. Second, a smart contract enabled data, and predictive analytics modules are developed using permissioned blockchain framework. The data and predictive modules aim to analyze veterinary clinic patients appointments data in order to discover underlying patterns and build a robust prediction model using machine learning algorithms. The data and predictive helps veterinary management to drive better future business decisions to provide better healthcare services to veterinary patients. Hyperledger Caliper is used as a benchmark tool to evaluate the performance of the developed blockchain-based system in terms of transaction per second, transaction success rate, transaction throughput, and transaction latency. Furthermore, machine learning performance measures have utilized, such as MAE, RMSE, and R2 score to evaluate the overall performance of the prediction model.

In this novel method, the ring signature is used to protect the privacy of the user in permissioned blockchains. On the other hand, the unconditional anonymity of ring signature may be abused maliciously by the adversary. Conditional anonymity is considered to improve the ring signature. Therefore, based on conditionally anonymous ring signature, permissioned blockchains privacy protection scheme has also been laid down. Furthermore, the effects of smart contract for transaction flows are considered. The asynchronous signing transaction process is proposed.

Supply chain financing scheme based on blockchain technology from a business application perspective,"Tsai, CH","Supply chain finance (SCF) essentially provides a flexible cash flow solution that maximizes the working capital situation for the main stakeholders in the supply chain. Buyers benefit from longer payment terms and reduced working capital requirements, suppliers have early and accelerated cash flow, and financial intermediaries obtain revenue by providing business finance. However, current SCF platforms have some opaque factors, such as information asymmetry that results in delayed payments to suppliers; this is particularly harmful to small and medium-sized enterprises. Cybersecurity risks (e.g., fraudulent invoices, duplicate transactions, and double-spending payments) have also been increasing rapidly and continue to threaten technology-reliant SCF platforms. Blockchain technology is a disruptive innovation that provides security benefits for business parties because of characteristics such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability; these elements enable SCF platforms to increase transparency and trust and decrease the potential of transaction manipulation among participants.

On-chain behavior prediction Machine Learning model for blockchain-based crowdsourcing,"Kadadha, M; Otrok, H; Mizouni, R; Singh, S; Ouali, A","In this paper, we address the problem of behavior prediction for task allocation in blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework. Centralized crowdsourcing frameworks complement workers' reputations with predicted behavior, through Machine Learning (ML) models, to improve the task allocation performance and maintain worker engagement. Existing blockchain-based crowdsourcing frameworks allocate tasks to workers using reputation solely, which neglects the impact of a task's context on the worker's behavior. Our contribution is an on-chain behavior prediction ML model for task allocation on top of a proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework. The ML model, hosted on blockchain, reflects a worker's unique behavior for a task given its context. The proposed ML model is: (1) trained off-chain since it has lower monetary cost compared to on-chain training, and (2) deployed on-chain as a smart contract to enable transparent predictions. The task allocation mechanism in the proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework considers workers' predicted behavior and a Quality of Information (QoI) metric that includes distance to the task, completion time, and workers' reputation. The evaluation conducted confirms that the proposed task allocation mechanism, implemented using Solidity, outperforms the benchmark in terms of percentage of allocation, workers' QoI, and reputation change.

SBRAC: Blockchain-based sealed-bid auction with bidding price privacy and public verifiability,"Chen, BW; Li, X; Xiang, T; Wang, P","Electronic auction (e-auction) has become one of the most popular approaches to allocate resources or services in contemporary society because of removing physical limitations of traditional auctions. The rapid expansion of e-auction enhances work efficiency but incurs some new and distinctive challenges such as low-robustness, data privacy, and lack of trust. To address the above concerns, various auction designs have been proposed by researchers from the academic and industrial circles. However, most of them fail in simultaneously achieving decentralization (i.e. auctioneer-free), privacy-preserving (i.e. bids privacy), collusion-resistance, and secure channel free. In this paper, we present an effective smart contract-based verifiable privacy-preserving sealed-bid reverse auction scheme, which not only has no need for trusted third parties, but also achieves robustness and privacy protection of losing bids even in the face of overwhelming collusion. In this scheme, the central auctioneer is replaced with some carefully designed smart contracts for decentralization, while zero-knowledge proof and anonymous veto networks are used to avoid the secret communication channel, support the public verifiability and detect the malicious behaviors of bidders. More practically, the complexity of the designed scheme is independent of the number of bidders. Finally, we implement a prototype of our design based on a locally simulated Ethereum test network.

Blockchain-oriented Inter-organizational Collaboration between Healthcare Providers to Handle the COVID-19 Process,"El Kassmi, I; Jarir, Z","Collaborative business activities have aroused great interest from organizations because of the benefits they offer. However, sharing data, services, and resources and exposing them to external use can prevent organizations involved in collaboration from being engaged. Therefore, the need for advanced mechanisms to ensure trust between the different parties involved is paramount. In this context, blockchain and smart contracts are promising solutions for performing choreography processes. However, the seamless integration of these technologies as non-functional requirements in the design and implementation phases of inter-organizational collaborative activities is a challenging task, as reported in the literature. Consequently, we aim in the proposed approach to extend the modeling and implementation of the choreography lifecycle based on service-oriented processes. This is fulfilled by integrating blockchain transactions and smart contract calls, to allow collaboration and interoperability between different entities while guaranteeing trust and auditability.

Blockchain-Based Processing of Health Insurance Claims for Prescription Drugs,"Alnuaimi, A; Alshehhi, A; Salah, K; Jayaraman, R; Omar, IA; Battah, A","The current legacy system used in processing health insurance claims causes a huge amount of financial loss every year due to fraud claims. It is also highly prone to privacy and security threats due to the use of traditional methods. Health insurance claims for prescription drugs are one such claim that is highly prone to being tampered with. Also, there is a lack of linkage in the prescription data between the medical care provider and the pharmacy, which also leads to miscommunication and the use of false prescriptions. In this paper, we propose processing health insurance claims for drug prescriptions using blockchain technology that manages the processing of prescription drugs in a private, secure, trustworthy, and decentralized manner. The proposed system utilizes a private Ethereum blockchain. The system includes two smart contracts: registration and approval smart contracts, which provide traceability and trustworthiness to the system. The system was integrated with off-chain storage (IPFS) and a fronted decentralized applications (DApps), which improves the accessibility of centralized patient information by authorized parties. To maintain the privacy of the data, a gateway is used to filter the data that can be viewed by the participants. We present the system architecture, sequence diagrams, entity-relationship diagram, and algorithms to demonstrate the working principles of the proposed process for processing health insurance claims for prescription drugs using blockchain. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated by conducting security analysis and comparing it to the existing solutions.

Automatic smart contract generation using controlled natural language and template,"Tateishi, T; Yoshihama, S; Sato, N; Saito, S","Smart contracts, which are widely recognized as key components of blockchain technology, enable automatic execution of agreements. Since each smart contract is a computer program that autonomously runs on a blockchain platform, their development requires much effort and care compared with the development of more common programs. In this paper, we propose a technique to automatically generate a smart contract from a human-understandable contract document that is created using a document template and a controlled natural language (CNL). The automation is based on a mapping from the document template and the CNL to a formal model that can define the terms and conditions in a contract including temporal constraints and procedures. The formal model is then translated into an executable smart contract. We implemented a toolchain that generates smart contracts of Hyperledger Fabric from template-based contract documents via a formal model. We then evaluated the feasibility of our approach through case studies of two types of real-world contracts in different domains.",2019,,IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,63,2-3,,WOS:000482784800007,10.1147/JRD.2019.2900643,,#929,Tateishi 2019,Exclusion reason: Methods/inputs/outputs not provided; ,""
Analyzing smart contract interactions and contract level state consensus,"Hu, YC; Lee, TT; Chatzopoulos, D; Hui, P","Although the primary function of distributed ledgers is to store data related to users' interactions, their capabilities allow them to offer more sophisticated functionalities. Advances in blockchain technologies introduced smart contracts, software programs that define immutable rules as functions stored on the blockchain and can be executed on demand. Smart contracts can interact not only with users but also with each other via message exchange. We compare existing smart contract interactions, and develop an architecture for asynchronous state consensus, a novel type of smart contract interaction required in applications but had rarely been addressed. The proposed architecture is composed of two types of smart contracts, ie, Custodian and Client. Client smart contracts serve as network participants reaching a particular consensus collectively by forming a cluster and issuing votes towards a final state agreement. Custodian smart contracts serve as the arbiters that aggregate and calculate voting results as the finalized state consensus that is shared across the network. To test the feasibility of our proposal, we conduct experiments on the consensus reaching latency and the scalability under different network configurations with standardized Amazon Web Service instances. Lastly, we discuss the robustness our proposal concerning Byzantine Fault tolerance and list possible applications. In the gaming industry, an ERC721 smart contract does not allow contrasting structural features between individual tokens, yet only minor value-level differences. The proposed solution can address the need for character diversity that characters can be created and attached to a gaming smart contract after deployment, which enables fine distinction between characters. The proposal can also achieve sharing states across smart contracts, such as the jackpot, which renovates the flexibility of blockchain gaming.",2020,,CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE,32,12,,WOS:000529224600003,10.1002/cpe.5228,,#931,Hu 2020,Exclusion reason: Framework Not Provided; ,""
MDA-Based Approach for Blockchain Smart Contract Development,"Jurgelaitis, M; Ceponiene, L; Butkus, K; Butkiene, R; Drungilas, V","Blockchain smart contracts can support the decentralisation of business processes, but due to smart contracts' specifics, their development is a complicated process. Introducing model-driven development principles in smart contract development can facilitate requirement specification, design, and implementation activities. This paper presents a model-driven development method MDAsmartCD (Model-Driven Architecture-based Smart Contract Development) to alleviate smart contract development by supporting the complete MDA life cycle, covering the definition of Computation-Independent Model, Platform-Independent Model, and two instances of Platform-Specific Models. In MDAsmartCD, model transformations (model-to-model and model-to-text) are used to produce smart contract code in the Hyperledger Fabric platform Go and the Ethereum platform Solidity programming languages. The method application was demonstrated by implementing the smart contract for the hackathon solution and executing the generated Solidity and Go smart contracts in the workflow of issuing certificates for hackathon participants. During the execution of the workflow, both deployed smart contracts behaved identically and recorded analogous results in respective blockchain data storages.

Model-Based Software Design and Testing in Blockchain Smart Contracts: A Systematic Literature Review,"Sanchez-Gomez, N; Torres-Valderrama, J; Garcia-Garcia, JA; Gutierrez, JJ; Escalona, MJ","Blockchain technology promises to spark a real revolution. One of most important concepts associated with this technology is smart contracts, which enable the automatic execution of agreements and augur a world without intermediaries. The conditions and rules of ""contracts"" are established in a computer codes and trust is enforced by consensus among the participants. One relevant feature associated with smart contract is the immutability property, which establishes the non-alteration of blockchain network data after the clauses of the contract are been approved by all parties or entities involved. For this reason, smart contract development requires more effort and care than the development of other common programs. They require systematic mechanisms to collect requirements and functional specifications. In addition, it is necessary to verify and validate the agreed functionality and the implemented code before they are deployed in the blockchain platform. This article presents a systematic literature review of primary studies in the field of Software Development Life Cycle, focusing on model-based software design and testing in the blockchain domain of smart contracts. This research aims to identify gaps and/or opportunities for further research.

Visual and User-Defined Smart Contract Designing System Based on Automatic Coding,"Mao, DH; Wang, F; Wang, YL; Hao, ZH","Smart contract applications based on Ethereum blockchain have been widely used in many fields. They are developed by professional developers using specialized programming languages like solidity. It requires high requirements on knowledge of the specialized field and the proficiency in contract programming Thus, it is hard for normal users to design a usable smart contract based on their own demands. Most current studies about smart contracts focus on the security of coding while lack of friendly tools for users to design the specialized templates of contracts coding. This paper provides a visual and user-defined smart contract designing systems. It makes the development of domain-specific smart contracts simpler and visualization for contract users. The system implements the domain-specific features extraction about the crawled data sets of smart contract programs by TF-IDF and K-means++ clustering algorithm. Then, it achieves the automatic generation of unified basic function codes by Char-RNN (improved by LSTM) based on the domain-specific features. The system adopts Google Blockly and links the generated codes with UI controls. Finally, it provides a set of specialized templates of basic functions for users to design smart contracts by the friendly interface. It reduces the difficulty and costs of contract programming.

Driving Licence Registration and Verification System using Smart Contract,"Kale, R; Raipurkar, AR; Chandak, MB","Every kind of business depends on the evolving technologies that tend to take advantages of new opportunities. With every new technology, different set of challenges appear. In recent years, numerous blockchain-based applications have been proposed to solve problems in different areas. In this paper, an adaptive strategy is proposed to eliminate driving license frauds using blockchain technology. With second generation of blockchain technologies, smart contracts have helped to develop trust and automated transactions between large numbers of users. Smart Contracts are programs that run on the blockchain to take action on the records. This paper proposes a driving license registration and verification smart contract using Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract mechanism allows for registration of the officers/agents by a higher authority. It can dynamically restrict unregistered officer/fraud agents from generating fake driving license. Also, the smart contract facilitates verification of a registered driving license which includes checking its validity and authorization. It provides special rights to the traffic regulator officer to add remarks to the driving license if the driving license holder is found violating the traffic rules. Since the blockchain is an immutable ledger, this remark cannot be tampered and the apprehended person would be liable to pay the fines. This would result in reduction of traffic accidents and violation of traffic rules.

Blockchain-based two-party fair contract signing scheme,"Zhang, L; Zhang, HL; Yu, J; Xian, HQ","A fair contract signing scheme ensures that contract signing participants can fairly exchange the digital signatures of the contract, which has a wide range of applications on the Internet. Verifiable Encrypted Signature (VES) can be used as a fair exchange mechanism for digital signatures, in which it requires a centralized Trusted Third Party (TTP) as an adjudicator. However, there are many security challenges with the centralized TTP. For example, it may disclose the contents of the contract, collude with others, or even occurs a service interruption. To address those problems, in this paper, we propose a two-party fair contract signing scheme based on Ethereum smart contract, which allows participants to fairly perform the contract signing procedures on the blockchain. Specifically, we propose a modified VES scheme in which no centralized adjudicator is needed. Then we design the fair contract signing scheme based on the modified VES scheme. We leverage the Ethereum smart contract technology to ensure fairness, which has the characteristics of decentralization, verifiability, autonomy, efficiency, and tampering resistant.

A Recommender System for Robust Smart Contract Template Classification,"Gec, S; Stankovski, V; Lavbic, D; Kochovski, P","IoT environments are becoming increasingly heterogeneous in terms of their distributions and included entities by collaboratively involving not only data centers known from Cloud computing but also the different types of third-party entities that can provide computing resources. To transparently provide such resources and facilitate trust between the involved entities, it is necessary to develop and implement smart contracts. However, when developing smart contracts, developers face many challenges and concerns, such as security, contracts' correctness, a lack of documentation and/or design patterns, and others. To address this problem, we propose a new recommender system to facilitate the development and implementation of low-cost EVM-enabled smart contracts. The recommender system's algorithm provides the smart contract developer with smart contract templates that match their requirements and that are relevant to the typology of the fog architecture. It mainly relies on OpenZeppelin, a modular, reusable, and secure smart contract library that we use when classifying the smart contracts. The evaluation results indicate that by using our solution, the smart contracts' development times are overall reduced.

We aim to translate the smart contract source code into natural language descriptions as fine-grained in-line comments to help people better understand, learn and operate smart contracts. Method. We propose an automated translation approach for smart contracts written in Solidity, termed SolcTrans, based on an Syntax Tree (AST) and formal grammar. We have investigated representative Solidity smart contracts, identified the AST parsing paths and core attributes used for translation, and proposed corresponding translation templates for special statements. Then, we leveraged reinforcement learning to train a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar-based syntax synthesizer used to generate comprehensible English sentences as comments. Result. The experimental results show that SolcTrans outperforms four state-of-the-art neural machine trans-lation models under currently available training data and is less affected by lengths of code snippets and translation outputs. We also conducted a human evaluation among 20 volunteers and asked them to score the generated comments.

Blockchain-enabled logistics finance execution platform for capital-constrained E-commerce retail,"Li, M; Shao, SJ; Ye, QW; Xu, GY; Huang, GQ","As one of the most prevailing retail channels, E-commerce has nowadays facilitated retailers to sell goods to customers worldwide and tremendously increased the supply chain efficiency by removing most intermediate links. The broaden business scope and accelerated goods circulation, nevertheless, have generally led to capital shortages for retailers, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Given the SMEs' difficulty in acquiring capital from financial institutions such as banks, logistics finance (LF) has emerged as an alternative, which is the combination of logistics and financial service. However, the frequent order fulfillment and diversity of pledges in E-commerce hinder SMEs in meeting LF's financing requirements. Furthermore, the current LF relies more on large and reputable third-party logistics (3PLs) to alleviate financing risks, which in turn raises the entry threshold for other 3PLs. Hence, this paper has proposed a blockchain-enabled logistics finance execution platform (BcLFEP) as an integrated solution to facilitate LF for E-commerce retail.

Interpretation of Contracts and Smart Contracts: Smart Interpretation or Interpretation of Smart Contracts?,"Cannarsa, M","The computer language (computer code) on the basis of which smart contracts are written is different from the natural (Human) language. Computer language is a 'dry' language, whereas natural language is 'wet'. In other words, it means that computer language is deterministic (just one meaning and one result are conceivable), when natural language is open to more and potential different meanings. Natural language requires therefore in itself interpretation, at least more than computer language. Computer language in theory doesn't require and possibly doesn't leave room for interpretation. If this assumption is accurate, what are the consequences of it (on the intention of the parties, on contract drafting, on courts' intervention.)? Building on that assumption, this article explores, from a comparative perspective, the impact of the blockchain- based smart contract technology, especially regarding contract drafting techniques. Contract drafting style in common law (long contracts, based on a 'if., then..' approach, quite similar to the coding approach) is in part based on the idea of preventing courts' interpretation and intervention. In civil law countries instead, contracts are generally shorter, for several reasons but partly because drafters tend to rely on more general legal concepts, external to the contract, and know that courts will play an important role, through interpretation, in disclosing the 'true meaning' of a contract. Coding contracts and relying on computer- code language can hence have a significant impact on the civil law approach and bring the two legal systems closer as far as contract drafting and contract interpretation are concerned.",2018,,EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW,26,6,773-785,WOS:000456959900004,,,#1162,Cannarsa 2018,Exclusion reason: Studies that do not present any data-driven techniques for converting contracts or documents to smart contracts; ,""

Blockchain-Based Medical Certificate Generation and Verification for IoT-Based Healthcare Systems,"Namasudra, S; Sharma, P; Crespo, RG; Shanmuganathan, V","Nowadays, medical certificates are very important for many users as they want to avail health benefits like tax purposes, insurance claims, legal procedures, and many more. Generating, issuing, and maintaining medical certificates remain a significant problem; before the invention of the computer, they were available as hard copies. The digitization of medical certificates and documents leads to potential security issues, such as forging of certificates risks the privacy of healthcare documents. Moreover, individuals still need to be physically present and wait at the issuing healthcare centers to get the certificates. Currently, the infrastructure of any healthcare industry connects the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and application software that communicates with the information technology systems. Blockchain technology with IoT can significantly affect the healthcare industry by improving efficiency, security, transparency, and can provide more business opportunities. Therefore, a privacy-preserving technique has been proposed in this article for IoT-based healthcare systems using blockchain technology.

A Blockchain-Based Approach for the Creation of Digital Twins,"Hasan, HR; Salah, K; Jayaraman, R; Omar, M; Yaqoob, I; Pesic, S; Taylor, T; Boscovic, D","The rapid advancements in computing, storage, communications, and networking technologies have enabled the creation of Digital Twins (DTs). A DT is a digital representation of a real-world physical component, product, or equipment. A DT can be used for 3-D design, testing, simulation, and prototyping prior to the manufacturing of the physical component. Once a physical component is in operation, a DT can be used for configuration, monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics. It is expected that DTs will gain significant attention in the foreseeable future, and will play a key role in Industry 4.0. However, todays approaches, systems, and technologies leveraged for the creation of DTs are mostly centralized and fall short of providing trusted data provenance, audit, and traceability. Also, data related to transactions, logs, and history are not secure or tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based creation process of DTs to guarantee secure and trusted traceability, accessibility, and immutability of transactions, logs, and data provenance. Our proposed approach uses smart contracts to govern and track transactions initiated by participants involved in the creation of DTs. Our approach also employs decentralized storage of interplanetary file systems to store and share DTs data. Moreover, we present details on our system design and architecture, implementation, and algorithms. Furthermore, we provide security and cost analysis, and show how our approach fulfills the requirements of DTs process creation.

Symboleo2SC: From Legal Contract Specifications to Smart Contracts,"Rasti, A.; Amyot, D.; Parvizimosaed, A.; Roveri, M.; Logrippo, L.; Anda, A.A.; Mylopoulos, J.","Smart contracts (SCs) are software systems that monitor and control the execution of legal contracts to ensure compliance with the contracts' terms and conditions. They often exploit Internet-of-Things technologies to support their monitoring functions, and blockchain technology to ensure the integrity of their data. Ethereum and business blockchain platforms, such as Hyperledger Fabric, are popular choices for SC development. However, there is a gap in the knowledge of SCs between developers and legal experts. Symboleo is a formal specification language for legal contracts that was introduced to address this issue. Symboleo specifications directly encode legal concepts such as parties, obligations, and powers. In this paper, we propose a tool-supported method for translating Symboleo specifications into smart contracts. We have extended the current Symboleo IDE, implemented the ontology and semantics of Symboleo into a reusable library, and developed the Symboleo2SC tool to generate Hyperledger Fabric code exploiting this library. Symboleo2SC was evaluated with three sample contracts. The results shows that legal contract specifications in Symboleo can be fully converted to SCs for monitoring purposes.

SmartCon: A Blockchain-Based Framework for Smart Contracts and Transaction Management,"Muneeb, M.; Raza, Z.; Haq, I.U.; Shafiq, O.","A smart contract can be used for automating business processes triggered by specific events caused by IoT sensors, data feeds, or other applications.

An Advanced Smart Contract Conversion and Its Design and Implementation for Auction Contract ,"Zhu, Y.; Qin, B.-H.; Chen, E.; Liu, G.-W.","As second-generation blockchain technology, smart contracts have greatly enriched the functional expression of blockchain to make application development more convenient. Smart contracts are a set of digitally executable protocols which concern business, finance, contract law, and information technology. In recent years, advanced smart contract languages (ASCLs) have been proposed to solve the problem of difficult reading, comprehension, and collaboration when writing a smart contract among people in different fields. However, this kind of languages are still hard to put into practice due to the lack of an effective conversion method from the ASCLs to executable smart contract programs. Aiming at this problem, we propose a three-layer smart contract framework, including advanced smart-contract layer, basic smart-contract layer, and executable machine-code layer. After comparing and analyzing the pros and cons of several ASCLs, we take SPESC as an example to explore how to design conversion rules from its contract to target language contract in Solidity. We specify the conversion rules from two aspects. One is program architecture of the target language, which consists of main-contract and party-contracts. The corresponding rules provide an approach to convert the definition of SPESC-based contracting parties into party sub-contracts on target language, as well as to produce the rest of SPESC contract into main sub-contract on target language. The other is the approach to specify not only program architecture and storage structure on basic smart-contract layer, but also important mechanisms, including personnel management, timing control, anomaly detection, etc. These mechanisms can assist programmers to semi-automatically write smart contract programs. Moreover, by introducing the notation of group, the SPESC-based smart contract can support the operation of dynamically adding participants into the contract. We also verify the legibility of SPESC and the correctness of the conversion processes through two case studies. First, we invite some students from department of computer science and department of law. They, divided into four groups, are asked to read voting and auction contracts in SPESC and Solidity, and answer questions designed for the contracts. The result shows that the speed of reading SPESC is about twice as fast as that of reading Solidity, and the accuracy of reading SPESC is higher. Then, taking the auction contract as an instance, we analyze the process of bidding contracts and compile them into contracts in SPESC, and then provide the whole process of converting from a SPESC-based contract to an executable contract program in Solidity according to the above conversion rules, and verify the correctness of the conversion process, including coding, deploying, running, and testing, through Ethereum private chain. The instance results show that the conversion rules and the three-layer framework can simplify the writing of smart contracts, standardize the program structure, and help programmers to verify the correctness of the contract program. In our future work, a formal representation shall be established on the existing SPESC language model. Through formal methods, we can further provide formal analysis tools to verify pre-and-post conditions of contract terms, as well as time sequence between terms. Secondly, in view of the correctness of the generated Solidity target code, we can continue to improve the generated target code based on existing researches on analysis or detection vulnerabilities, optimize the program structure and specifications, and enhance the security of the contract. © 2021, Science Press.

An off-the-chain execution environment for scalable testing and profiling of smart contracts,"Kim, Y.; Jeong, S.; Jezek, K.; Burgstaller, B.; Scholz, B.","Smart contracts in Ethereum are executable programs deployed on the blockchain, which require a client for their execution. When a client executes a smart contract, a world state containing contract storage and account details is changed in a consistent fashion. Hence, the execution of smart contracts must be sequential to ensure a deterministic representation of the world state. Due to recent growth, the world state has been bloated, making testing and profiling of Ethereum transactions at scale very difficult. In this work, we introduce a novel off-the-chain execution environment for scalable testing and profiling of smart contracts. We disconnect transactions from the world state by using substates to execute the transactions in isolation and in parallel. Compared to an Ethereum client, our execution environment reduces the space required to replay the transactions of the initial 9M blocks from 700:11GB to 285:39GB. We increased throughput from 620:62 tx=s to 2;817:98 tx=s (single-threaded) and 30;168:76 tx=s (scaled to 44 cores).

One major advantage of this approach is that it allows an out-of-the-box integration with the Why3 framework, namely its VCGen and the backend support for several automated theorem provers. We also discuss the use of our tool to automatically prove the correctness of diverse annotated smart contracts. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,,"Proc. - IEEE Int. Conf.

LATTE: Visual Construction of Smart Contracts,"Tan, S.; S Bhowmick, S.; Chua, H.E.; Xiao, X.","Smart contracts enable developers to run instructions on blockchains (eg. Ethereum) and have broad range of real-world applications. Solidity is the most popular high-level smart contract programming language on Ethereum. Coding in such language, however, demands a user to be proficient in contract programming and debugging to construct smart contracts correctly. In practice, such expectation makes it harder for non-programmers to take advantage of smart contracts. In this demonstration, we present a novel visual smart contract construction system on Ethereum called latte to make smart contract development accessible to non-programmers. Specifically, it allows a user to construct a contract without writing Solidity code by manipulating visual objects in a direct manipulation-based interface. Furthermore, latte interactively guides users and makes them aware of the cost (in units of Gas) of visual actions undertaken by them during contract construction. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",2020,,Proc.

Towards developing trusted smart contracts in simulink,"Meng, B.; Li, M.; Beckmann, B.; Nishida, Y.; Carbone, J.; Yang, D.; Durling, M.","Blockchain has emerged as a subject of intense interest in research fields and beyond. One of key enabling technologies is smart contracts. Smart contracts bring transparency, simplicity, and efficiency to blockchain applications. Several languages and tools have been developed for smart contracts over the years but few are easily usable for domain experts in control systems as most of them are Simulink users and learning a new language and tool could be a challenge for them. In this paper, we propose a trusted smart contract development approach in Simulink Stateflow for blockchain applications. The approach introduces a design environment and generates evidences of trust for smart contracts via formal verification, simulation, automated test generation, and test execution. Finally, the formally verified Stateflow models is automatically synthesized into Solidity for deployment on blockchain platforms. This approach will not only bring the assurance of smart contracts to the next level, but also will make the blockchain technology accessible to the control experts, which could inspire broader blockchain applications in industry. We implemented the framework as a toolbox in Simulink, which has been used by GE Research. We will demonstrate the capabilities and effectiveness of the toolbox using a real transactive energy example to show that valid issues are identified along the development cycle.

Modelling principles for blockchain-based implementation of business or scientific processes,"Jurgelaitis, M.; Butkienė, R.; Vaičiukynas, E.; Drungilas, V.; Čeponienė, L.","Blockchain technology and smart contract development currently lacks clarity in its implementation. The complicated architecture of blockchain is an obstacle that developers face during design and implementation of blockchain-based systems.

Enriching Smart Contracts with Temporal Aspects,"Fournier, F.; Skarbovsky, I.","Blockchain technology provides a platform for the decentralized execution of smart contracts. A smart contract is an agreement that is automatically executed when certain conditions are met. Current smart contracts use business rules to express conditions in which transactions occur but lack the capability to reason over time. We present a model-driven approach for creating blockchain applications that can run temporal logic. We present the new concepts required at the model level and explain how these concepts can be translated to a blockchain solution applying Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Composer, and PROTON complex event processing. We illustrate the approach using a pharma cold chain scenario. Cold chain scenarios are typical examples of blockchain cases in which temporal reasoning is required. Here, the blockchain provides transparency, a non-repudiation process, full traceability and trackability of the transactions (provenance), shorter lead times, and authentication and verification of the parties in the supply chain network at each asset transfer. The temporal reasoning is required since decisions about pharmaceutical quality is based on time windows in which the goods have been exposed to certain conditions. Our solution includes the model, the blockchain backend, and a mobile user interface that allows each certified and authorized party in the network to initiate actions, finish their transactions, and track progress. It also includes temperature monitoring to ensure compliance with the proper conditions for transportation and asset transfer. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2019,,Lect. Notes Comput.

Formal requirement enforcement on smart contracts based on linear dynamic logic,"Sato, N.; Tateishi, T.; Amano, S.","Recently, despite the growing popularity of smart contracts, one serious concern is arising among both industry and academia, that is, whether they work autonomously without human intervention really as intended and, when we are not sure, how we can ensure that contracts meet particular requirements. To resolve this, we propose a new formal approach to smart contract development: Instead of defining contracts just as programs in conventional languages, they should be defined using formal logic so that we can verify whether they meet particular requirements and enforce them if necessary. The primary challenge is that expressive formal logic often turns out to be undecidable and consequently executable programs cannot be generated. As a solution, each contract definition is divided into two layers, namely specification layer in a decidable logic called Linear Dynamic Logic for verification and enforcement of requirements and rule layer for defining implementation details, while the consistency between the two layers is systematically guaranteed. Based on this, it also becomes possible to automatically generate executable contract programs from their formal specification, which leads to improving the trustworthiness of contracts. Evaluation on Hyperledger Fabric shows the feasibility and high effectiveness of our approach. © 2018 IEEE.",2018,,"Proc. - IEEE Int. Congr. Cybermatics: IEEE Conf. Internet Things, Green Comput.

SPESC: A Specification Language for Smart Contracts,"He, X.; Qin, B.; Zhu, Y.; Chen, X.; Liu, Y.","The smart contract is an interdisciplinary concept that concerns business, finance, contract law and information technology. Designing and developing a smart contract may require the close cooperation of many experts coming from different fields. How to support such collaborative development is a challenging problem in blockchain-oriented software engineering. This paper proposes SPESC, a specification language for smart contracts, which can define the specification of a smart contract for the purpose of collaborative design. SPESC can specify a smart contract in a similar form to real-world contracts using a natural-language-like grammar, in which the obligations and rights of parties and the transaction rules of cryptocurrencies are clearly defined. The preliminary study results demonstrated that SPESC can be easily learned and understood by both IT and non-IT users and thus has greater potential to facilitate collaborative smart contract development. © 2018 IEEE.",2018,,Proc Int Comput Software Appl Conf,1,,132-137,,10.1109/COMPSAC.2018.00025,,#1934,He 2018,Exclusion reason: Framework Not Provided; ,""
Toward A Service Platform for Developing Smart Contracts on Blockchain in BDD and TDD Styles,"Liao, C.-F.; Cheng, C.-J.; Chen, K.; Lai, C.-H.; Chiu, T.; Wu-Lee, C.","In recent years, Blockchain technology has been highly valued, and the related applications have begun to be developed in large numbers. A smart contract is a software component encompass business logics and transactions that run on a blockchain. Thus, verifying whether the contract logics fully reflect the business requirements are one of the most important software engineering issues in blockchain application development. Currently, developing smart contracts is still a challenging task even for experienced programmers due to the lacking of an integrated tool for developing and testing. In response to this challenge, this paper presents a service platform that supports BDD-style (Behavior-Driven Development) smart contract development, testing, and deployment for the Ethereum-based blockchains. This platform focuses on providing and resolving the cross-cutting concerns across the life-cycle of smart contract development. The feasibility of this platform is shown by demonstrating how an application scenario, namely, loyalty points exchange, can be implemented using the proposed platform. Our experiences indicate that the burdens of developers when developing smart contracts can be effectively reduced and thus increases the quality of contracts. © 2017 IEEE.",2017,,"Proc. - IEEE Int.
